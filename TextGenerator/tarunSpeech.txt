The very idea that abortion can be considered murder implies the foetus is a conscious living thing.
But that’s not the case, Embryos and foetuses are not independent, self-determining beings, and abortion is the termination of a pregnancy, not a baby.
A person’s age is calculated from their birth date, not conception, and foetuses are not counted in any Census.
Foetuses can’t feel pain let alone anything else at the recommended stage for abortion.
According to a review by Britain’s Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, most neuroscientists believe that the cortex is necessary for pain perception
The cortex does not become functional until at least the 26th week of a foetus’ development, long after most abortions are performed.
Many women who choose abortion don’t have the financial resources to support a child. 42% of women having abortions are below the federal poverty level.
This means without an option for abortion, most if not all those children would have a very poor quality of life without access to proper nutrition and education.
It also burdens the mother.
A survey in the peer-reviewed Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health asking women why they had an abortion found that 73% of respondents said they could not afford to have a baby, and 38% said giving birth would interfere with their education and career goals.
